Launchpad Toys,S11,,San Francisco,"Creativity at Play.  Tablet toys.   Acquired by Google, 2015.","We're creating digital toys and tools that empower kids to create, learn & share their ideas through play.

Give a young child a couple of toys or a box of crayons and he or she is likely to play for hours, deeply engrossed in an imaginary world. In both art and dramatic play, children construct settings, create fictional characters, and act out fantastic storylines that would be the envy of many Hollywood scriptwriters. Yet, ask that same child to write out a story in a blank notebook or a word processor and you would be lucky to capture a fraction of the depth and splendor of his or her imagination. Play inspires and scaffolds the creative process from an early age, but there is a persistent gap between the origins of imaginative play (ages 4-5) and kids' adoption of the formal discipline of creative writing (ages 8-10).

At Launchpad Toys, we're using mobile devices like the iPad to bridge this gap between informal and formal learning, to harness the power of play to help children capture and share their ideas with other kids around the world. Our first product, Toontastic an app for the iPad, is a creative learning tool that blends constructionist and social development theories to empower young children to create, learn, and share their ideas through play.",https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/launchpad-toys

Yet, most teachers are only provided with resources that teach one specific level. To overcome this, teachers work nights and weekends to find the perfect piece of content for each of their students. Then, during the day, they work with their classes in small groups so they can personalize their instruction as best they can.

"Lucy Goods, Inc",W18,2016,"Los Angeles, CA",Lucy’s mission is to reduce tobacco-related harm to zero. We provide…,"If it isn’t bad enough that smokers don’t realize the scientific facts about nicotine, most non-tobacco nicotine products are poorly designed and unappealing to use. The leading gum is sold like a pharmaceutical drug, with flavoring and packaging to match. Vapes provide a cumbersome, over-the-top experience — with use as tightly restricted as cigarette smoking itself, but more juvenile, conspicuous, and highly addictive. People want, and deserve, a better way.

Therefore, we want to deliver nicotine users a superior experience, and at the same time give them a way to transition out of feeling dependent. In a better society, people wouldn’t carry around the sensation that they’re stuck with an involuntary habit. Our mission isn’t to encourage nicotine use among people who haven’t started. Unlike certain vapes or other products, ours isn’t the sort coveted by underage users on social media. Our mission is to alleviate the harm related to tobacco — first and foremost, by switching people away from the most harmful products.

So, at Lucy, we take an evidence based view of nicotine. Nicotine’s pleasurable properties make it an inevitable part of modern society. Therefore, minimizing harm in all nicotine products is key, in addition to giving people products and strategies for cessation. We feel that, as 1,300 people are dying of tobacco related illnesses every day in the US, the most important and immediate step toward a better society is giving nicotine consumers products they enjoy using that will cause less harm.

Our first product is designed to appeal to smokers and encourage them to switch. And, looking ahead, we hope to secure approval in the future as a clinically proven smoking cessation aid, while continuing to participate in the FDA’s public hearings around how NRTs are best regulated. Our goals are simple: because harm reduction is a better strategy around nicotine delivery than abstinence or prohibition, we want to help improve public health — and reduce its costs — through a superior pure nicotine product.",https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/lucy-goods-inc

We prioritized overcoming this hurdle first, and we were successful! We developed an entirely new way of producing growth factors - which are the key (and most expensive) component of cell culture media. We realized this technology could solve the same problem all lab grown meat companies face. 

Given our mission to singlehandedly kickstart the next agricultural revolution, we decided to pivot and focus on enabling the entire industry to succeed.

Volumetric is a recognized world leader in building living multicellular tissues, with a focus on replicating discrete functions of the human body for basic mechanistic biology, laboratory testing and screening, and drug development. Founded in 2018 by Bagrat Grigoryan and Jordan Miller as a spin-out from Rice University, the full potential of our work is to build whole human organ replacements for patients, made from their own cells.

Our Technology and Approach
We have invented a suite of breakthrough 3D bioprinting technologies, featured on the cover of Science, that can build human tissue with complex blood vessel networks. We are leveraging this technology in the short term to build patient-specific tissues for drug safety and efficacy testing. Patient cells are taken from a biopsy, added to our proprietary 3D printed tissues, and then drug compounds are injected through the blood vessel network to mimic actual drug delivery in humans. Our vision is that our technology will provide rigorous, reproducible, and predictive outcomes for patients, resulting in drastically improved outcomes for diseases like cancer. More broadly, we see the full potential of our mission as being able to produce functional tissue and organ replacements for diseased or damaged vital organs in the body such as the lung, liver, pancreas, kidney, and heart.

Tires are the perfect vertical to tackle first because they are future-proof (tires are going nowhere) and scale from luxury personal automobiles to freight-centric big-rigs. The current tire changing industry is entrenched with an aging workforce but maintains strong margins. We will build and deploy a robotic tire changing container that can change tires in 10 minutes. 

Our fully-integrated ROBOTIRE containers can be placed inside existing shops, Walmart parking lots or in the middle of a fleet service area hundreds of miles away from a major city. In the medium term, we will expand to brakes, oil, batteries, etc. becoming an uptime assembly line that keeps fleets on the road 24/7 at a fraction of the maintenance cost per mile we see today.

At Protex AI, we’re on a mission to protect the industrial workforce! We’re building a proactive computer vision tool for workplace safety - empowering industrial Health and Safety (HS) teams to identify risk and danger before it becomes a problem.

🤕 The Problem:
Keeping people safe at work is extremely hard. In the U.S. alone, there were over 5,000 deaths in the workplace in 2019, mainly in the heavy industry space.

Serious workplace injuries cost U.S. businesses circa $62 Billion annually. Until now, safety has been reactive, someone has to get injured, and in some cases fatally before something is done about it.

✅ Problem Solved:
Protex AI’s platform uses privacy-preserving camera monitoring software to provide companies with an always-on guardian angel, protecting their workforce.

The platform plugs into existing CCTV infrastructure and enables HS teams to flexibly translate their document-based safety rules into the real world.

Protex AI takes these rules and autonomously audits the customer’s facility to identify areas of high risk and non-compliance.

HS teams can access this data via a reporting engine and use it in weekly safety meetings, external safety audits, insurance discussions, and legal claims.

The tool integrates seamlessly with existing safety workflows to augment data produced by any manual incident logging system in place.",https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/protex-ai

Our first product is a small molecule therapeutic for stimulants like cocaine and methamphetamine, of which there are no FDA approved treatments.

Our small molecule technology are atypical inhibitors of the dopamine transporter. Cocaine itself is an inhibitor of the same transporter. Directly reducing craving or positive reinforcement is a successful treatment strategy for addiction. Methadone or buprenorphine (Suboxone) are key examples of this for opioid use disorder. However, these types of medications can be addictive themselves. This has been a major hurdle for medication development for cocaine addiction and has led to many leaders in the addiction space to abandon the dopamine transporter as a target. At EncepHeal, we believe that the dopamine transporter should not be abandoned and instead focusing on fixing the abuse liability problem. Therefore with our partners at the National Institutes of Health, we have shown that these new, allosteric modulators at the dopamine transporter do not display addictive tendencies in animal models. They are also effective at curbing cocaine addiction. 

Our management team has two co-founders, Omeed Rahimi and Aaron Lazarus, as well as an experienced addiction pharmacologist as their research officer. The team has an advisory board with entrepreneurial and addiction drug development experience as well as expert partners at the National Institute on Drug Abuse, a subset of the NIH, and Wake Forest.

Our team has had success in raising non-dilutive funding and has expertise with SBIR/STTR grants. We are looking for help in better connecting with the biotech/pharmaceutical industry.

At AppHarbor, we believe that developing and deploying .NET application should be simple and fun. AppHarbor has been designed to tie in with developers day-to-day workflows. Deploying a new version to AppHarbor is as simple as checking in code when a new feature is ready.

AppHarbor will run most ASP.NET applications without modification. Moving an application to our platform requires no AppHarbor-specific code modifications nor installation of plugins or other custom software.

400M millennials in India don't invest because they don't have enough time, knowledge or access to large capital. With Spenny, they just connect the card and invest every time they spend.

We're growing 67% WoW since launch, with 3,000+ users and $15,000 in AUM. Indians put $500Bn into their bank accounts annually. We charge 1.75% of the AUM for investments. That's a direct ~$9Bn market in India alone.

Potentially every time a user makes a transaction, we make money. And in that sense, the timing for Spenny couldn't have been better: 1 Trillion+ transactions are expected in 2021 because of factors like Whatsapp launching its P2P payments in India for its 400M users. And the emergence of UPI means every Indian has a virtual bank account now. 

More interesting revenue models develop from the transaction data insights of our users. We analyse the rich data to A) up-sell more financial products like insurance etc., and B) create brand loyalty programs & partnerships.

We launched with money market funds and have ~40,000 customers who’ve invested (~40% MoM growth). The pandemic spurred interest among new investors, and our AUM has grown 3x since April 2020. And we’ve done this with a cost of acquisition that is 10% of the industry average. 

Here’s the problem we see. Only 10% of the 100 million middle-income Indian workers have invested in the markets. This is despite the fact that they save ~30% of their income, making this a $325B potential market in assets under management. 

However, current investment apps in India are built for active investors. With over 16,000+ mutual funds and 5000+ stocks to choose from, they are far too complicated for beginners, who make up most of the market.

We also offer users a credit card secured by their investments, so they can earn return without losing liquidity.

The gameplay in GraffitiGeo gives you points for checking into certain locations, similar to FourSquare, but doesn't really let you do anything with them. With GraffitiGeo, you earn points for every action you take, be it voting on a restaurant or leaving a brief comment. Once you've reached a certain point threshold, you can use those points to start a ""mob"", which you can invite your friends to join. Mobs allow friends to pool their points, which can then be used to acquire territory, which corresponds to actual city blocks. Whenever someone votes on one of the restaurants on the block, the mob gets some street cred too.

Numero,W19,2019,San Francisco,Modern financial software that powers our democracy.,"On January 3, 2019, we launched Numero. We didn’t have customers. We didn’t even have code. But we did have an idea: what if we could build financial software that powers our democracy? 

Running for office is hard work – the outdated software that runs campaigns makes it even harder. We believe it doesn’t have to be that way. That’s why we built Numero, a modern financial platform that Democratic elected officials and candidates at all levels of public office can use to manage the $4.5 billion in annual contributions to their political campaigns.

There’s been a 40% increase in the number of people running for office in recent years. Inspired by the current state of politics, people from every background imaginable have stepped up to run, including our CEO, Brian, who ran for Congress in 2018. Our other two co-founders, Susie and Karan, led the finance and technology arms of his campaign. They learned firsthand the painful process of manually stitching together critical finance and compliance data using outdated campaign software.

Our mission is to change that painful process and liberate hard-working candidates, campaign staffs, and volunteers, letting them focus on their most important work: talking with voters and representing their constituents in their communities.

In our first two years, we’ve already helped more than 200 campaigns raise $832 million. And there’s much more room for us to grow. The US has more than 500,000 elected officials, and many more candidates run for office at all levels of government. ",https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/numero

Membo lets you order food directly from hundreds of local food producers & organises delivery so you always get the freshest version of every product.

Bountiful,W17,2015,San Francisco,"Farm, market, and buy smarter with actionable forecasting.","We’re on a mission to optimize the agricultural industry.

When we started Bountiful in 2015, the grape error rate for predicting production was 30 percent. Why? We found that many farmers in the specialty crops space were still using traditional pencil-and-paper techniques to predict yield. These low-fidelity forecasting methods weren’t giving them a clear enough understanding of their production until it was too late, leading to waste and inefficiency throughout the supply chain.

We saw a problem we wanted to solve.

Today, Bountiful is using advanced data science to help farmers forecast more accurately, so they can make better decisions. In the last three years, we’ve combined the latest in machine learning with weather, satellite, geographic, and historical data. The result is a user-friendly platform that transforms volumes of complex agricultural information into simple, actionable insights farmers can use to run more economically and environmentally sustainable farms.

More recently, we’re working to open the dialogue between buyers and sellers, remove uncertainty, and provide clarity to the supply chain to meet global food demand.

Our ultimate goal is to close the agricultural margin of error. Not only will this make individual farms more efficient, profitable, and sustainable, but it will help optimize the global food supply chain. That means healthier people and a healthier planet.",https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/bountiful

FitFu,W11,,"Ringwood, NJ",New projects,"It all began in January 2009 when our founders - wandering digital sage Jof and software guru Benjie - released an innocent little app called PushupFu. The result of countless sleepless nights, numerous rolls of duct tape, a few everyday household objects, far too many takeouts and some epic battles with a kitten... it was released into an unsuspecting world at the entirely inappropriate time of 2am on New Year's Eve.

Soon one app become four, and before we knew it we had lots of happy users and lots of great coverage by all sorts of people such The Telegraph, Wired, O'Reilly and MacFormat. Being a friendly bunch, we took the time to chat with the hundreds of you who said hello, and we found you all had the same problem: gyms were either too expensive, too daunting, too boring or too inconvenient. In other words, a lot of people needed another way to stay active.

And the more people we spoke to, the bigger this problem seemed to be - it was like almost no one was active enough! Big problems require big solutions, so after raising some money from the visionaries at 4iP we amassed a team of the best designers, artists, 3d animators and programmers with the single mission: to improve the fu of the world by making an app so damn good that everyone will want to stay active.

Fitfu allows you to:

* Track your motion

Using the accelerometer on your iPhone or iPod Touch, FitFu gives you feedback to help you keep going and reach your goals.

* Celebrate progress with friends

Friends are the key to sticking to your goals, so we've made FitFu social; whether you want to cheer them on, thank them for help or just compare your progress.

* Discover a new way to stay motivated

The more you and your friends are active, the higher your level and the higher your points. And points mean prizes; unlock new content as you progress.

* Stay active wherever, whenever

No more being tied to a games console or a gym, now you can stay active wherever you are - be that your bedroom, your office, a hotel room or in the cabin of your Mississippi boat. (Yes it happens!)

*Lose what you want

This process is broken. We install cameras and remote monitoring software on the assembly line, and this ensures compliance with test protocol, improves quality, reduces liability, and helps fight warranty fraud.

We charge a nominal per-unit fee to the OEM and revenue share with the factory when they demonstrate compliance with quality standards (whether units pass or fail).

Pandai,S21,2020,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Learning app for school students in Southeast Asia,"💡 What is Pandai?

Pandai is an app that helps students get better grades in school. 

Pandai provides gamified quizzes aligned to a specific school curriculum, from which students can learn, practice, get feedback, and diagnose their weaknesses.

🔥 Why do we build this? 

In Southeast Asia, the education system is competitive and exam-oriented. 

There is a huge demand for interventions (tutors, workbooks, and extra classes) to help students perform better in school. Pandai fills the demand with a solution that is better than the alternatives.

👨‍🏫 Who We Are

The three founders are based in Malaysia and have known each other since high school, 23 years ago. 

After we graduated (from MIT & other US colleges), we started our first education company in 2007, focusing on coaching school students in STEM subjects.

We worked closely with students (many of them from underprivileged backgrounds) and saw firsthand the impact we’ve had on them. 

We then realized that with technology, we could reach more students and bring more impact. Hence, we released Pandai in 2020. 

🚀 Present & Future

Currently, we have launched in our home ground Malaysia in 2020. 

So far, 280,000 students have completed 83 million questions on Pandai, and 92% of users have seen some improvement in their academic performance. 

We plan to expand to Southeast Asia and other emerging markets, a market of 100M+ school students. Pandai is designed to be scalable, and our content (also available in English) can be mapped to other curricula from other countries. ",https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/pandai

Obesity and type 2 diabetes have reached epidemic proportions. There are 2.2B overweight people and 500M people with type 2 diabetes worldwide, and these numbers increase drastically every year. Existing drugs are not effective enough to reverse the trend. Our drug can solve this problem, because it addresses the root cause of metabolic disorders – the imbalance between caloric intake and expenditure.

Our drug will target mitochondria – the powerhouse of the cell – to generate heat. This approach has been proven to fully reverse obesity and type 2 diabetes in animals. However, therapeutic application for humans was impossible, because mitochondrial heat production could only be induced by highly artificial methods with side effects. This changed after our recent breakthrough discovery of the protein that mitochondria naturally use to generate heat. We have developed a unique high-throughput drug discovery platform to identify compounds that selectively activate this target protein, without side effects.

For decades people have wanted a drug that burns calories like exercise does. We are realizing this dream at Equator Therapeutics.",https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/equator-therapeutics

With a team that has over 70+ years of small molecule drug development experience, we intend to do the same with chronic liver diseases, which affects over 20 million Americans and represents a market size of over $30 billion. 

We know we are well positioned for success because we have shown excellent pre-clinical mouse data in several liver fibrosis models using our novel small molecule. We demonstrate a reduction in fibrosis with our drug, but more significantly, we show a reversal in fibrotic tissue back to normal tissue.

Dropprint Genomics,W20,,San Francisco,The better way to run single cell genomics,"Who we are?
We write software that understands the activity of individual cells as opposed to all cells. This approach is novel because we are no longer looking at average signals and can be precise. It is like a police person trying to identify the speeding car, they won’t find it if they look at all the cars at once, rather they need to look at the speed of each individual car. This is the beauty of single cell genomics, we can now identify that speeding car.

Why now?
The biggest barrier for entry into the single cell genomics market are cost and data analysis. To that end, we have reduced the cost by 10-fold and built the computational infrastructure for scalability. Although single cell sequencing has only been around for about five years, we come from one of the top single cell genomics labs and were the first to process and analyze millions of immune cells. Thanks to our software solutions, we have been able to bring big data solutions to the immune system.

Where are we and where are we going?
We have generated a database of over 1 million immune cells spanning healthy, cancerous, and autoimmune immune cells and are growing through paid partnerships. Harnessing out database and ML software, we can take a data-centric approach for better target discovery. Fortunately, as our database continues to grow, our models will continue to learn for more precise, unbiased, and automated single cell genomics.

Thread combines the best bits of tech with the best bits of personal styling: After signing up by completing a short questionnaire and uploading photos of yourself, you’re paired with a stylist who reviews your information and uses Thread’s proprietary algorithm to sort through thousands of items to create the best outfits for you. When you log onto Thread, everything you see is tailored to your sizes, budget, preferences and tastes.

Mela,S19,2019,"Bengaluru, India",Pinduoduo of India,"Mela is the Pinduoduo of India. A group shopping app where people can shop together with their friends on WhatsApp and Facebook and get huge discounts.

Remember when your first Flipkart order arrived? You went through hundreds of products in their website, chose one that you liked, mostly cheaper than you could have gotten it in any offline shop (if it was available in an offline shop that is), and it shows up at your door. Remember that delight? There are 800 million Indians who are yet to experience that. So far, eCommerce in India has been only making inroads in the top income decile of the population. The price points for most products in eCommerce sites are largely out of bounds for the majority Indian population. There was no economically feasible way to sell low priced goods (think 200Rs shirt) to the rest of the population over internet. With WhatsApp and Facebook, group buying is just a click away. And because we can accumulate a large amount of orders for the same product this way, the prices go down significantly. Making it finally possible to sell a 200Rs shirt online and still have a positive unit economics. THIS is how we think eCommerce will be made accessible to majority of Indians.

This is how Pinduoduo democratized eCommerce for the less affluent in China.They are the fastest growing eCommerce company in the world, IPOing in a record three year time,They are already the second largest eCommerce player in China (launched only in 2015).

It turns out Latam is an even better market for this model than the U.S. In Latam 50% of produce is wasted along the supply chain and the “Supply Centers” unique to Latam's major cities make it easy to source from many local farmers at once vs. one at a time.

In Mexico, the produce market alone represents a $3.7B opportunity, which serves as the beachhead to create Latam’s #1 brand for sustainable food and attack its $909B Grocery Market.",https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/perfekto

Their mission is to have a positive impact on the environment, local communities, and the housing crisis through their sustainable approach.

Mighty Buildings' technology has the potential to unlock the needed productivity for large scale construction alongside the opportunity for reduced emissions, leading to a more sustainable product and future. Mighty Buildings was founded by a team of physicists and robotics engineers with extensive experience solving hard R&D problems and building successful engineering firms.

This allows them to produce prefab housing with up to 80% of operations automated.

Mighty Buildings has a near-zero waste production process, preventing 1,100 - 2,000 kg of CO2 emission per 3D-printed home. They are committed to achieving Net-Zero by 2028 - making the company 22 years ahead of the construction industry.

So it's a win-win deal : For businesses downtime is minimized, and for DevOps engineers they need not worry about a deluge of alerts and midnight wake up calls.

HistoWiz's mission is to fight cancer cooperatively instead of individually by connecting scientists and pathologists for online collaboration.

The HistoWiz advantage
We help your lab minimize the cost of research and maximize research productivity by providing the most efficient service for scientists to analyze experimental pathology specimens. We believe that scientists should spend their time on results interpretation rather than repetitive tissue cutting.

To expedite delivery of results and to facilitate global collaboration, HistoWiz offers whole-slide imaging and pathology services, allowing researchers to remotely and instantly view high-magnification images of their specimens via a secure, cloud-based “virtual microscope” on any computer or mobile device without downloading any software or gigabyte-sized files.",https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/histowiz

Cheddar,S14,,,The Best Mobile Checking Account,"Ditch your bare-bones, high-fee checking account. You deserve free and powerful everyday banking.

Nearly 3 out of 4 millennials would rather go to the dentist than listen to their bank. While it's possible that we just really love our oral hygiene, it's more likely that we don't trust or like our banks.

It's not hard to understand why. Big banks use big budgets and armies of salespeople and marketers to sell old-school products layered with fees and penalties. Their profits increase when we spend more, overuse debt, and make mistakes like overdrafting.

Big banks get away with this because banking is such a vital service. Everyday spending and saving decisions that begin at the checking account ultimately determine whether we'll lead a healthy and secure financial life.

What can be done? Bill Gates believes banks aren't necessary for banking. Millennials believe technology companies can make banking better. So let's build a better bank.

Cero,S21,2017,"Santiago, Chile",Automated communication between hospitals and patients in Latam,"At Cero, we solve specific coordination tasks between hospitals and patients, such as appointment confirmations and last minute cancellations, by automatically communicating with patients over WhatsApp. For example, a patient can confirm and reschedule their appointment without needing to call anyone.

Almost half of the medical appointments in Latin America are missed because patients simply do not show up. This ranges from missing a regular dentist check to missing an expensive MRI scan. With increasing pressure to improve access to care in developing countries, optimizing communication and coordination with patients is a key task to achieve. This is a massive problem especially in places where most people don't know how to effectively use self-service mediums (or are too busy to use them).
 
We bootstrapped the company and we are profitable. We currently have $97K in monthly revenue from 15 clients with a CMRG of 20% in the last year. We have 100% logo retention and we grow with our clients. We are currently coordinating over 600,000 medical appointments every month, just in Chile.

This problem represents a $3.5B market opportunity in Latin America only. Latin America has 650M people, each one having an average of 3 medical consultations per year. We charge for every time we effectively communicate with a patient. We plan to handle several coordination interactions with every patient for each consultation, which considers a roadmap of scheduling, confirming, booking, reimbursements, payments, among others.

We are a team mixing strong knowledge about the healthcare industry with deep technical skills. Felipe (CEO) is a former dentist that has led deep changes in healthcare payments in Chile. Mauricio (CTO) and Jorge (R&D), both PhD in Computer Science, led the creation of the most advanced Spanish Language Neural Network used daily by scientists and practitioners in LatAm (BETO: Spanish BERT).

In a weekend project, Mauricio and Jorge automated the communication with students attending a summer school obtaining impressive engagement. Felipe was struggling with contacting his patients to coordinate appointments, and saw a big opportunity in this technology.

Spero Foods,S18,2018,"Oakland, CA",dairy reinvented from plants,"People want plant-based dairy. But, today, plant-based dairy is prohibitively expensive due to the use of nuts as the primary ingredient. 
 
I created Spero (sperofoods.co) because I wanted everyone to be able to eat clean dairy alternatives that actually taste good. So, I leveraged my background in engineering, chemistry, and art to develop Spero's patent-pending formulations and brand.
 
At Spero, we make dairy from seeds. 
 
Why seeds? Almonds/cashews (nuts), which comprise the majority of the dairy alternatives industry today, will never create cost comparable products with dairy because they are too expensive and they're hard to scale. They take too much time, space, water, and human labor. Seeds are 7-8x less expensive and grow 50-70x faster than nuts.
 
Spero owns exclusive rights to the technology needed to transform seeds into dairy alternatives. Not only does our pending-patent cover novel processing techniques for cheeses, but it’s comprehensive for all dairy alternatives, including milk, creamers, yogurt, and even eggs.
 
By using truly scalable ingredients and cutting-edge technology, Spero will be the first company to make plant-based dairy cheaper than traditional dairy products. Spero will be the first company to make dairy alternatives mainstream.

Not only is this expensive, but it's also inefficient, which is why at Peer5, we've created a P2P CDN to boost your video streaming capabilities. 

Our CDN works with your servers to ensure that as your viewership increases, your network gets stronger by offloading bandwidth to our peer network. On average, this has been shown to increase server capacity by 20x, offload 70% of bandwidth, increase viewing time by 30% and decrease instances of rebuffering by 40%.

Our video streaming CDN uses emerging technologies, including HTML5 and WebRTC. They require no installation by end users and offer easy integration for content providers. We support many different streaming protocols, players and media servers.",https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/peer5

Booktrope is reinventing the way books are published. We are not a self-publishing operation. What does that mean? At Booktrope we do not charge authors to publish nor do we accept all submissions.

We have pioneered a concept called “Team Publishing” which addresses the way books are actually developed, not just the way they are distributed and read. We offer print, ebook, and web versions of all our books, in other words, we are format agnostic. We don’t want to debate the death of print books, or the birth of ebooks, we love and support them all. 

A typical Publishing Team consists of an author, editor, designer and business/marketing manager for the book. You don’t get assigned projects in our system; you choose the people you work with.  We work much more quickly than traditional publishers, taking advantage of new technologies to streamline the process of getting books into the hands of readers. Lastly, we use that same technology to keep overhead low, and we think that the bulk of the revenue from book sales should go back to the creative team that makes them happen.",https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/booktrope

However, despite its great utility in fitness and health, cardio-metabolic analysis has long been restricted to very few fitness and medical centers due to the cost, size, and complexity of traditional cardio-metabolic analyzers. PNOĒ is changing that with the first portable, low cost, and medical grade cardio-metabolic analyzer which comes with a data interpretation service, allowing anyone from a personal trainer to a cardiologist to apply cardio-metabolic analysis in his practice without the need for specialized skills. 

Our team has extensive experience in gas sensing technologies, cardio-metabolic analysis, nutrition and physical exercise prescription, cardiovascular & pulmonary disease diagnosis and hardware development (firmware, electrical engineering, mechanical design).  

We are on a mission to make cardio-metabolic analysis the health checkup of the future and we are excited to get in touch with anyone who believes he can help. Our initial approach was to start by making cardio-metabolic analysis accessible to the world of competitive fitness but very quickly saw great interest from the general population fitness and wellness market. As a result, our current focus is to offer cardio-metabolic analysis as a diet/physical exercise prescription as well cardiovascular/pulmonary disease prevention tool in fitness & wellness centers. In this direction, we are deploying PNOĒ in as many fitness & wellness centers as possible (i.e. gyms, boutique studios, private clinics, wellness retreats, corporate wellness centers etc.) so support through introductions and recommendations is highly appreciated.

MyPetrolPump,S19,2017,"Bengaluru, India",On demand fuel delivery service in India,"Why did we pick this idea to work on? 
India is a country with 200 mln vehicles (about the same number as USA) but one third the number of gas stations(60K) as compare to USA(160K), The consequence of odd number of fuel stations is long queues of vehicles at the gas stations to fill up, heavily congested Indian roads make it worse. Opening of 100K new fuel stations is practically & economically impossible in urban localities due to rocketing high land prices. And that's how the idea of mobile refueling was conceptualized by founders. Literally ""bringing the gas stations to doorsteps"". The problem of buying fuel is much more alarming in large volume consumer segments such as Vehicle fleet users like schools, cab rentals, freight logistics operators , tours and travels operators, hospitals, hotels, real estate etc who burn huge amount of dead mileage & loss of productivity while sending all fleet vehicles to gas stations to fill up. Additionally, India has a unique problem of Electricity blackouts. Current avg. is less than 18 hours of a day of electricity in Indian metro cities, which causes more than 20 mln household and commercial buildings running on backup generators which require Diesel. They cant bring the generators to gas stations either therefore they buy Diesel in jerry cans or barrels and transport unsafely. Our solution is solving the desperate & daily need of Indian consumers along with convenience.

Do we have domain expertise in this area? 
Founder is ex veteran of Shell with 9 years of global experience, has complete understanding Oil marketing business.

😫 The problem 

For 6 million online tutors worldwide, the #1 pain point is: Students’ Zoom boredom.
Because a bored student is a customer who won’t stay long.

😎 The solution

We built a gamified platform for online tutors to teach kids online.

45,000 classes later, it’s clear that kids love this metaverse and beg their parents for more classes. This translates into higher retention and more business for tutors who use Koala instead of Zoom.

💰 Monetization

With a premium subscription, tutors unlock additional tools to grow their business.
The long term monetization will be to match parents with tutors.

📈 Market

In 2021, parents paid $149B to online tutors.

A startup in exactly our space, Outschool, is worth $3B, 5 years after YC. 


In 10 years, Koala will be the #1 place for online tutors to build their business.

We will raise $3M-$4M seed in March 2022 before Demo Day. If you’re an awesome investor, please contact Xavier at xavier@teachwithkoala.com.

Oncobox,S17,,"Walnut, CA",Finding the right cancer drug for each patient. ,"Oncobox believes that many late-stage cancer patients are dying prematurely because doctors lack a data-driven tool to help them decide which drugs currently on the market would be most effective in fighting individual patients’ specific cancers. That’s where Oncobox comes in. Oncobox is low-cost personalized genetic profiling to help doctors decide which drug to use. In a recent study conducted by leading cancer researchers in Europe and Asia on 900 patients with a variety of late-stage cancers, Oncobox increased the effectiveness of targeted therapies from 25% to 64%.

How does Oncobox work? Over 150 targeted cancer drugs are currently on the market. But deciding which of these drugs to give to late-stage cancer patients is not a simple task. Cancer doctors are in a race against the clock, they don’t always know which drug will be most effective for their patients, and because these drugs are expensive and typically have significant side effects, they can’t just try them all. Because of these barriers, targeted cancer therapies are effective only 25% of the time, and 70% of patients with late-stage cancers die due to the toxic side effects of ineffective drugs.

At an estimated cost of $2,000 per patient, the Oncobox Integral Test analyzes DNA and RNA of over 2000 genes that are included in major molecular pathways using algorithms to distinguish which molecular targets are the most crucial for individual cases and finds the right drug for them. Doctors receive a clinically actionable report that shows them which drugs are likely to be most effective on the patient.

We are actively seeking partners from pharma, hospitals/clinicians, payers, and genomic centers. If you are in Oncobox for your patients, contact us at hello@oncobox.com.

MayaEats,S21,2020,"Sunnyvale, CA",The World's Largest Virtual Restaurant Chain.,"MayaEats is doing to the restaurant industry what AirBnB and Uber did to homes and taxis, building the world's largest restaurant chain without owning the kitchens and its operations (Hyper Scalable Model). 

It is very common to find a lot of restaurants with underutilized kitchen capacity, meaning they are currently serving 50 meals a day whereas their capacity is able to accommodate 200 meals a day. Some of the estimate suggests there could be a million underutilized kitchens in the US alone and a-lot more globally. Also we noticed most of the mom & pop stores lack branding and marketing skills which makes it difficult for them to compete against larger chains.

MayaEats creates highly profitable and highly scalable delivery only brands based on data. Then, we partner with qualifying brick-n-motor / cloud restaurants who have under utilized kitchens nationwide who fulfill orders which are delivered via third-party delivery services including Doordash, UberEats, Grubhub and many others. MayaEats provides menus & recipes with full training and handles all promotions. Restaurant owners have to do only one thing well, prepare delicious food for the customers.

So far launched 60+ digital stores, processed around 53,000 orders, made around $1.85 Million in GMV and $375,000 in revenue.

LunaJoy utilizes technology and data science to provide intelligent touchpoints that decrease costs and accelerate outcomes. We are increasing our in-network footprint to provide truly accessible care for all. 

Women are twice as likely to experience mental health difficulties. Rates are even higher for women of color and LGBTQ+ folks. Women are 3x more likely to experience sexual, physical, emotional trauma which is a predictor for mental illness. This is just the tip of the iceberg! Physiologically, women experience hormonal fluctuations which make them more vulnerable to mental health issues during times of transition such as puberty, pregnancy, postpartum, and menopause. We also face unique stressors as the emotional bedrock of our homes, supporting young families, elderly adults, and a huge part of the workforce. The downstream effects of this gap in care are far-reaching into our ecosystems. Currently, mental health care is expensive, inconvenient, and generalist where a specialized approach is needed. When we attend to women’s mental health, we all shine brighter!",https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/lunajoy

Arpeggio Bio,S19,,"Boulder, CO",Arpeggio builds technology to watch and learn how drugs work. Our…,"Arpeggio builds technology to watch and learn how drugs work using the epigenome. Scientists have been measuring gene activity in our cells for over twenty years now, but it’s remained a mystery how diseases are able to turn certain genes on or off. Breast cancer, for example, is driven by 198 genes being activated when they shouldn’t be, and we don’t know why.

But that’s about to change. Just a few years ago, biologists discovered new molecules that turn genes on and off. Collectively, these molecules are known as the “epigenome,” and they’re the control switches that determine how our cells work and give rise to disease. 

At Arpeggio, we’ve developed a platform of biological and computational tools that make it possible to record changes in the epigenome over time and watch the results like a movie to see how drugs work. This gives scientists a clear understanding of how drugs and diseases function and has enabled our customers – including four of the top 10 pharmaceutical companies in the world – to match the right treatments to the right patients, screen new compounds, and reposition existing drugs into new indications.

Once all of the shares of the property are sold, we retain no ownership stake in the property and transition into the role of property manager, ensuring the home is well maintained and handling any issues that arise.

Meanwhile, there's a proven treatment that increases survival rates by 600%, and it's low cost, discreet, and convenient. It's called MAT, and it looks like treatment for anxiety or depression: medication plus therapy. However, doctors need a special waiver to prescribe the medication, which fewer than 5% of them have, so it's difficult to get, and most people are buying it on the street. Sadly, drug dealers aren't doctors: every 11 minutes another American dies of an opioid overdose, now the #1 cause of death for Americans under 50.

Ophelia is replacing rehab with telemedicine, using proven science and a consumer-first approach. The opioid treatment market in the U.S. is $15B, and 85% of opioid addicts have insurance that pays for it. We're treating roughly 400 patients with thousands more waiting.

Zealth,W21,2020,"Bengaluru, India",Software for remote monitoring of cancer patients,"Zealth is building remote monitoring software to help hospitals provide automated continuous round-the-clock support to their cancer patients post-discharge. 

Hospitals are overburdened with no resources to provide care to their chronic patients once they leave the hospital. For instance, in India, there are only 2200 oncologists for 1.38 billion people. Patients travel 100 miles waiting for hours to get few minutes with the doctors. They have no easy means to manage all the toxicities and symptoms they get once they are back home. This leads to 6X lower patient retention, 4X high emergency readmissions, and poor patient outcomes.
